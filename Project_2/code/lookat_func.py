    Computes the camera's view transformation from eye position, up vector and target point.
    
    Parameters:
        eye (np.ndarray): 3D position of the camera center (shape: 3,)
        up (np.ndarray): Up vector of the camera (shape: 3,)
        target (np.ndarray): 3D target point the camera looks at (shape: 3,)

            R (3Ã—3): Rotation matrix from world to camera coordinates
